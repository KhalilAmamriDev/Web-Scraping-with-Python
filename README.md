# Web Scraping with Python â€“ Wuzzuf Job Listings

This project demonstrates how to use Python for web scraping, specifically to collect job listings related to Python from [Wuzzuf.net](https://wuzzuf.net/). The script extracts job titles, company names, locations, skills, posting dates, and links, then saves the data into a CSV file.

## Features

- Scrapes multiple pages of job listings automatically
- Extracts key job information: title, company, location, skills, date, and link
- Saves the data in a CSV file for easy analysis
- Uses `requests` for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `lxml`
  - `csv` (built-in)
  - `itertools` (built-in)

Install the required libraries with:

```bash
python -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

## How It Works

1. The script sends HTTP requests to Wuzzufâ€™s job search page for Python jobs.
2. It parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup and the lxml parser.
3. For each job listing, it extracts:
    - Job title
    - Company name
    - Location
    - Skills required
    - Posting date
    - Job link
4. The script loops through all available pages until there are no more jobs to scrape.
5. All collected data is saved to `jobstutorial.csv`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python web_scraping.py
```

4. After running, check the `jobstutorial.csv` file for the results.

## Example Output

The output CSV file will look like this:

| Job Title                | Company Name | Date        | Location         | Job Skills                | Links                  |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
